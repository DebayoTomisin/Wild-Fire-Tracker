The idea is simple folks
We built an application that tracks wild fires across the entire planet using the NASA and Google map API

So i'm making a bit of changes to the application yeah, moved the inital prject to a folder NonRedux or something of sorts, then created a new folder with the redux version of the project, same principle just redux will be used to manage state and all like that.
